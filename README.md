Objective:
The objective of the project is to find out the quadratics of user input numbers and quadratic value by using a Python Programming Language.

Task: 
1)	Following a quadratic format of AX^2 + BX + C, ask the user to enter the value of A, B, C and X.
2)	Then calculate the value of the quadratic
3)	The program should output the quadratic along with the value of the quadratic

Assumption/Relation used:
AX^2 + BX + C (where, A, B, and C are variables)

Process: 
1)	User is asked to enter the value of A, B, C and X
2)	Then the quadratic entered by the user is displayed
3)	The value of quadratic is calculated using the relation AX^2 + BX + C
